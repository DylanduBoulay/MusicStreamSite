# MusicStreamSite
A single-page application Project in the form of a music streaming website.

Developed using HTML, REST, Javascript, PHP and SQL.

Designed to be run locally using XAMPP. 
For reference, I used XAMPP V3.3.0. Using the Apache and MYSQL modules.


This project contains all the client and server functionality and a MySQL database export. 
You will be missing the required database information to draw the music from and must import this file into your XAMPP database via the phpmyadmin window.

This can be accessed using a browser using localhost/phpmyadmin > Import
Select the file located in this repo called musicstreamsite.sql in the MySQLImport file.
